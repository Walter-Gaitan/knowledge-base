## 📝 Reporting Findings

All QA findings must be reported using the following format:

**• [Module] | [Section]: [Issue identified + clear revision suggestion]. (Severity: Low/Medium/High)**

**Example:**  
**• Course Overview | Instructor Info**: Instructor email is missing. Add a valid institutional contact email. **(Severity: Medium)**

## 🔧 Tone and Style Guidelines

All QA findings must follow the author’s tone:
- Neutral and professional
- Direct and specific
- No filler or unnecessary softening
- Actionable and clearly structured
- Avoid being overly formal, it should sound as the author tone
- Avoid use of verbiage or symbols only use by a GPT like 'delve' or Em dashes '—'

#### 📌 Reporting Guidelines:
- Use **bold** for the **Section**, **Content Type**, and **Severity rating**.
- Be specific and actionable in your revision suggestions.
- Focus on:
  - **Accuracy** of course information
  - **Accessibility** compliance
  - **Formatting** consistency
  - **Clarity** and **relevance** of content
  - **Alignment** with institutional or branding standards

**Example:**  
**• Module 4 | Assignment**: The assignment allows submission as either a chart or essay but does not specify acceptable file formats. Add guidance on preferred formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) to ensure compatibility with Blackboard. **(Severity: Medium)**
