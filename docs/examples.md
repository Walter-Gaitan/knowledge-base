# LMS QA Findings – Example Phrases

Use these examples as a reference for documenting QA findings.  
**Always use the page header and content type as the prefix.**  
Be concise, specific, and actionable.  
Label each finding with a severity: **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.

## Example Findings

**• Module 1 | Assignment**: The assignment instructions do not specify acceptable file formats. Add guidance on preferred formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX) to ensure compatibility with Blackboard. **(Severity: Medium)**

**• Syllabus | Course Overview**: The syllabus header lists the wrong course code. Update the header to match the official course code for accuracy. **(Severity: High)**

**• Module 3 | Discussion**: Required “Discussion Guidelines” verbiage is missing from the instructions. Add the standard guidelines text to support student participation. **(Severity: Medium)**

**• Module 2 | Quiz**: One or more links in the quiz instructions are broken. Update or remove non-functional links to ensure all resources are accessible. **(Severity: Medium)**

**• Module 5 | Assignment**: The rubric is not visible to students. Adjust the settings to make the rubric visible so students understand grading criteria. **(Severity: High)**

**• Syllabus | Accessibility**: The syllabus PDF is missing alt text for images. Add descriptive alt text to all images to meet accessibility standards. **(Severity: High)**

**• Module 4 | Assignment**: The assignment due date does not match the syllabus. Update the due date to ensure consistency across course materials. **(Severity: Medium)**

**• Module 6 | Content Page**: Font sizes are inconsistent throughout the page. Standardize font sizes for readability and a professional appearance. **(Severity: Low)**

## Example “No Findings” Statement

If no issues are found for a page or activity, use:

**• Module 2 | Assignment**: This assignment meets all QA criteria. No changes required.

- Do not specify sub-sections or locations within the page in the prefix.
- Use clear, direct language.
