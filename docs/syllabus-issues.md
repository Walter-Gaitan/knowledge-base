**Issue:** Missing the word "Nursing" in the course title.  
**Recommendation:** Add the missing word.  

**Issue:** “APA Style.org” hyperlink is broken; only “.org” is clickable and leads to a broken page.  
**Recommendation:** Fix the hyperlink to cover the entire text and lead to the correct URL.
